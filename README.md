## ðŸ“– Refrences
This project is built in refrence with Maximilian's Udemy React Course (https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux).

He built a food-order app in 11th and 17th module in this course and taking refrence from it and using firebase as a backend and API alternative, I built this pharmacy store named Pharma-street.
